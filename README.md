# Monster-Game
Text based game where the user fights various monsters and accumulates gold.
I wrote this code when I was teaching myself C++ from the website www.learncpp.com. This is an exercise from one of the chapter summaries. 

To build the game; run make

To play the game; run ./MonsterGame

To generate documentation for the game; run doxygen Doxyfile.
